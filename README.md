# JSS Caffeinate
#### JSS Caffeinate triggers the Jamf keep alive mechanism, on all tabs it is running on, keeping you logged in.

## Why
JSS Caffeinate comes out of frusturation of constantly having to re-login when working with multiple tabs.

## How to use
To use this, you'll need to load it in a userscript browser plugin.  See blow for some plugins I know about.

Once loaded, change the `// @match` line to match your JSS URL, but don't include a port number.
